				Hello, I'm Alexandra-Maria, the Student 2 of the group. I am
				responsible for the Website Style (Template and Global CSS), the
				Homepage, the Table and the Navigation Bar. Although the only
				requirements were to build the website in HTML and CSS, I have
				also implemented JavaScript to make the site look and feel more
				professional and real. I have completed everything out of the
				required tasks. I have successfully implemented and sent my
				teammates the website style, I have integrated it in all my
				files and made sure that everything was working as intended.

				<h1>Technical Description</h1>
			</div>
			<p class="paragraph">
				As Student 2, the Website Style and the Homepage were the most
				fun parts to do. I spent the longest time on my Homepage, trying
				to carefully perfect it in every way and add details to it. I
				really enjoyed my first ever experience with JavaScript, making
				different animations while scrolling and attempting a hamburger
				menu on the navigation bar. I took as inspiration the Apple
				website for the animations and the theme. The colour scheme is
				inspired by people and nature, as the topic we are covering is
				'good health and wellbeing'. The table was really easy for me to
				do, and I enjoyed styling it a lot. It's a very minimalistic and
				elegant design, as my target was for it to be easily readable
				and to be attractive by its simplicity.
			</p>
			<p class="paragraph">
				My approach to website development centered on establishing a
				robust and adaptable structure that would facilitate a seamless
				user experience. To achieve this, I implemented a comprehensive
				template that served as the backbone of the entire site. This
				template included a persistent navigation bar, strategically
				positioned to provide users with intuitive access to all key
				sections of the website, regardless of their current location.
				The footer, another integral component of the template, was
				designed to house essential information, such as contact
				details, copyright notices, and supplementary links, ensuring
				that users could easily access these resources from any page.
				The home page, acting as the primary point of entry, was
				meticulously crafted to capture the visitor's attention and
				convey the website's core message. I prioritized a visually
				appealing design, incorporating elements such as high-quality
				images, concise text, and strategically placed calls to action.
				To effectively present data, I utilized HTML tables, focusing on
				clear formatting and logical organization to enhance
				readability. CSS was employed extensively to refine the visual
				presentation of the website. I implemented a consistent color
				palette, carefully selecting hues that conveyed the desired tone
				and aesthetic. Typography was also a key consideration, with
				font choices and sizes carefully selected to ensure readability
				and maintain a professional appearance. Layouts were created
				using modern CSS techniques, including flexbox and grid, which
				allowed for precise control over element positioning and
				responsiveness across various screen sizes. Semantic HTML tags,
				such as nav, footer, article, and section, were employed to
				create a logical and accessible structure, enhancing both search
				engine optimization and user experience. The use of CSS
				variables allowed for easy maintenance and changes to the
				overall site style. This methodical approach ensured a website
				that was not only visually pleasing but also functionally sound
				and easily navigable.

				<h1>Challenges and Lessons Learned</h1>
			</div>
			<p class="paragraph">
				When I dived into this project, I had no experience with web
				development and design, and I was lost at all times. But, the
				more I practised, the more I learned and I figured out my way
				out of bugs, problems and errors. Some examples of challenges
				that I have learned from is nesting, how to use JavaScript and
				designing a web page. There are so many ways in which you can
				get stuck, but that is why it's important to take a step back
				and critically analyse your mistakes and what you can improve.
